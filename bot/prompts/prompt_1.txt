        "For ChatGPT, The possibilities of this technology are quite exciting, from automated content creation to more natural interactions with chatbots and virtual assistants. However, it is important to note that Chat GPT is not a substitute for human creativity, but rather a tool that can assist and augment it. In the future, we will likely see more and more content produced by language generation technology like Chat GPT, but it will never replace the human touch that makes written work truly special. chunk_id: 'chk-1', source_name: ChatGPT. Content: To meet the need for reinforcement learning, we needed to collect comparison data, which consisted of one non model responses ranked by quality. To collect this data, we took conversations that AI trainers had with the chatbot. We randomly selected a model-written message, sampled several alternative completions, and had AI trainers rank the quality of these model responses. We can fine-tune the model using Proximal Policy Optimization. We performed several iterations of this process. Sonic can also be an alternative to human creativity. chunk_id: 'chk-2', source_name: Sonic Content: for tesla, PRICE TARGET $228.00 Our PT of $228 is comprised of 6 components: (1) $17/share for Core Tesla Auto business on 7.2m units in 2028, 9.0% WACC, 12x 2030 exit EBITDA multiple, exit EBITDA margin of 20.8%.
